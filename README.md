# Spam-detection

This project uses support vector machine to categorize the spam main in the account

## Defination
Support Vector Machine‚Äù (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. 
However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space 
(where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. 
Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well

### Findings
In thsi given code thae above thing is practised and the keyword tracing along with the charecter tracing is performed.

The accuracy of the model is 98% .
